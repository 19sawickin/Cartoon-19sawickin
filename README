HANDIN:
Final handin


DESIGN CHOICES:
For my composite shape, I decided to go with a house because I've always been super into
HGTV and home renovations. I could literally spend an entire day watching flip or flop or
House Hunters while browsing through Zillow. It's an unhealthy obsession haha.

With that in mind, I constructed a house in its own separate Pane then added this Pane to
the root pane, which I made a BorderPane. This border pane also contained an HBox at the bottom
that held the Quit button and the changing label.

Logically speaking, the App class contained the PaneOrganizer class, which contained my Cartoon class
that served as the top-level class with a timeline, two event handlers, the house, and the label.
